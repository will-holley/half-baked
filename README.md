A community-sourced collection of half-baked projects.

## Motivation

Sometimes you're working on a project that you just can't finish.  It could be a because of a lack of time or motivation, the project has grown too complex, or perhaps you found something else that's unexpectedly similar.  If you don't want to your time and energies to have gone to waste, share your half-baked project.  You could be the inspiration for someone else finishing their project, find a collaborator or maintainer for your own, or find the re-invigoration to finish it up!
